LED Camping Lantern AC Charging Circuit for www.surfncircuits.com blogLS

My LED camping lantern stopped worked this summer right before a family trip to Yosemite.    When I took it apart to find out how to repair it, I discovered how dangerous the device can be while charging the lantern with the AC power connection!    While charging the device, the USB connector (used to charge your iPhone) can have 120vac present, representing a shock hazard that could be deadly!    In this post, I'll describe the shock hazard, how to avoid it, show the teardown and hack the lantern to make it safe and give some advice so others won't make the same purchase mistake I did.
